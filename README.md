## Project Description

This project is a data mining project focused on improve the general classification result(MSE) of regression model by apply pre-processing algorithms from the fields of:
- Feature normalization and standarization
- Feature selection
- Feature extraction

The project is a collaboration between the Masiso Enjoyers group, consisting of the following members:

- Marcin Kapiszewski (code) - 156048
- Maciej Janicki (presentation) - 156073
- Adam Tomys (report) - 156057
- Marcel Piotr Precelek Rojewski (szef szef√≥w) - 156059

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [House Pricing dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) from Kaggle. It provides various features related to residential properties and their sale prices.
